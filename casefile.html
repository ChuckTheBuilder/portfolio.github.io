									<h1>MicroStays<br />
									Product Case Study</h1>
									<p>This case study was developed as part of EntryLevel’s Product Management Program. I was tasked with developing the requirements for a new product prototype for Booking.com. Booking.com is one of the largest online travel agencies in the United States.<br />
										The new product is hotel micro stays, which offers customers the flexibility to book hotel rooms by the hour and not for the full night. This case study documents the product launch strategy which includes defining and validating the customer problem / solution / market size, prototype ideation, crafting user stories, as well as identifying and prioritizing features to be built.<br />
									</p>

								<h2>Case Study Overview</h2>
								<ul>
									</p><li>Situation: Booking.com is considering launching a new product called MicroStays that allows customers to book hotel rooms for flexible and convenience stays shorter than the traditional overnight booking</li>
									<li>Task: Develop a MVP (minimum valuable prototype) to help inform what features should be included in product launch. The basis for the MVP was developed by identifying target customers and their needs through assumption mapping, conducting market research, and conducting interviews with potential customers. </li>
									<li>Action: In order develop the MVP for this product features were developed and prioritized. Prioritization was decided upon based on effort to accomplish and user needs.</li>
									<li>Result: Developed and designed a MVP to validate and test our hypothesis. </li><p>
								</ul>
								<section>
									<h2>Problem Statement</h2>
									<p>For travellers who want to experience a destination for less than 1 full day but require the comfort and amenities of a hotel MicroStay by Booking.com is an online travel agency that gives travellers the power to book each step along their “travel”.<br />
									Unlike traditional bookings like AirBnB this product is provides travellers with convenient, flexible, and short term travel accommodations. We’ll know this is true when eligible travellers see microstays as the viable option for short term hotel stays 
								</section>
								<h2>User Segmentation</h2>	
							<header>
							</p>Booking.com is an online marketplace in which hotels and property owners list available rooms and homes for travelers to book nightly stays. Booking.com also supports experiences which could be a complementary product to MicroStays. However, the focus of this case study will be the traveler side of the marketplace. </p>
								<h3>Potiental Users</h3>
								<ul>
									<li>Young professionals who enjoy traveling during their leisure time. </li>
									<li>Parents with children on traveling sports teams in which the family has to visit other cities for events and tournaments. </li>
									<li>Influencers who want new locations to create (film) content.</li>
								</ul>
							</p>The user this case study will focus on will be young professionals who enjoy traveling during their leisure. In 2021 domestic leisure travelers spent over $750 billion which is up from $555B in 2020 <sup>(1)</sup>. Additionally, research supports that Millennials travel more than any other generation at 35 travel days per year and Generation Z is a close second with 29 travel days per year <sup>(2)</sup>. MicroStays are the perfect opportunity to unlock new travel experiences for traveling young professionals that want to spend more time exploring with the same comfort they are used to.  </p>

									</p>Microstays is a new product from Booking.com for travelers who want to experience a destination for less than 1 full day but require the comfort and amenities of a hotel. Booking.com would be a first mover in this space by offering hourly stays at popular hotel brands. <br />
									</p>	I recommend Booking.com develop a MVP for MicroStays targeted towards young professionals who enjoy traveling. The MVP should address travelers desire flexibility and the comfort of popular hotel brands when book short term stays.
									</p> The success of the MVP will will be measured by monitoring the click through rate, bounce rate, and successful reservations of visitors during the test period. <p>
